HOLY SHIT IT'S STRING TIME EVERYONE

ANY STRINGERS IN CHAT????

## Making a string
When writing a new language, you basically have two options for storing a string in memory
1. Store the bytes of the string along with the number indicating the length of the string
2. Store the bytes of the string, and mark the end of the string with a special byte called the *terminator*
